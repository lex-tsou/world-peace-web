The way to achieve this goal is FULL weapon recycling by all. Please help on this idea.
<h2>On people level:</h2>
People need to recycle their guns. No guns are needed to protect ourselves. Even for hunting lets use bows and arrows.
<h2>On public services</h2>
Still guns are not needed. Tasers are a good alternative. Also, some weapons with strictly plastic bullets might be needed at cases but that is it.
<h2>On army</h2>
Since we stop using guns there is no need for any other weapon as well. No need for army.
<br/> Please help recycle all weapon arsenal and then enter public services to assist in the communities.
<br/> Army camps should eventually return to the community as parks museums etc. Tourists could fly on unarmed F-16 and travel on navy boats.
<h2>On people making arms</h2>
People have to work for a living but should not work for a killing.
As a result, please first of all recycle all weapons and then find different areas to assist the community.
<br/> There are too many challenges ahead, no need for weapons. Need to target space and guard against asteroids and meteors.
<br/> Need to help doctors treat patients. Need to help humanity evolve, not kill each other by producing the means to do that.
<h2>Countries:</h2>
Each country considers army as a way to protect their own. But if no weapons exist no need for army.
<br/> It is risky to be a unarmed country but that is a risk worth taking. A country shutting down its army would make clear that it would not attack anyone ever.
<br/> That country would be the one that other people would not fight as well. How to fight without weapons?
<br/> The world needs few volunteering countries to make that step. This list here is a bottom-up list, start from country level and progress steadily to the top.
<br/> Which country would be first? Who should consider that people lives are more important than money, countries, ideas, believes etc?
<br/> I challenge Greece to be the first country, to show to the world that some ancient wisdom still exists for people to follow.
<b>Greece can you make that huge step?</b>
<br/> Of course, the challenge goes further.
<br/> USA what you believe here? Can you make the first step? You like to lead so go ahead and make that lead :)
<br/> China you are also in the list as all other countries of Earth. Go ahead, be the lead.
<br/> Even if you govern a small country in any part of the world you can make the lead. Do not wait for others.
<br/> Countries are just big groups of people and here we try to help people so please, please people ask your country to make that decision. Act!

    This is a webpage created by Lex Tsou to share to the world the need for World Peace and add actions for people, organizations, countries to follow to achieve that goal by yesterday!
    <br/> Too many people die from pandemics, deceases, accidents etc for army to exist.
    <br/> English language is used on this page because it is a common language to share the message but not my main language. Feel free to translate this work as you please.
